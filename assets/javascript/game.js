// Psuedo Code
// We need to generate a Random Number on the screen.

// This Random Number needs to be in between 19-120

// We need Four Crystals that act as buttons.

// Every Crystal is attached a random number between 1-12.

// Every time we win or lose, a new random number is
// attached to each respective crystal.

// Each time we click on a Crystal, it should be adding
// itself to the previous chosen Crystals number value.

// Crystal Values are added until your score equals that 
// of the Random Number.

// If it is not equal, we lose and begin over again.

// If it is equal, we win and count it as a win.
